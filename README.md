<h1 align="center">VOD to Media Library</h1>

<p align="center">A Dispatcharr plugin that turns your VOD catalogue into a folder of <code>.strm</code> files (with optional NFO metadata) that media servers — Jellyfin, Emby, Kodi, ChannelsDVR — can index and play.</p>

<p align="center">
  <i>v1.16.0 — slug <code>vod2mlib</code></i>
</p>

> **Note on scheduled rescans.** The cron task routes via Dispatcharr's `dvr` Celery worker as a workaround for an upstream plugin-task-registration issue affecting the default prefork worker pool ([Dispatcharr#1244](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr/issues/1244)). The routing is transparent — no user action required for new installs. If you originally set up your schedule on **v1.14.1 or earlier**, click `[SCHEDULE] Apply / Update` once after upgrading so the stored task picks up the new routing.

> **Plex users:** Plex does *not* play `.strm` files. Jellyfin and ChannelsDVR do. See [Plex compatibility](#plex-compatibility) below.

## Install

1. **Map a host folder to `/VODS` in your Dispatcharr container** (see [Sharing the VODs folder](#sharing-the-vods-folder-with-media-servers) for *why* this matters and how to share with other apps).

   ```yaml
   # docker-compose.yml
   services:
     dispatcharr:
       volumes:
         - /opt/dispatcharr-vods:/VODS
   ```

2. **Install the plugin** — two options:

   - **From the official catalogue (recommended):** Dispatcharr → Plugins → **Find Plugins** → search "VOD to Media Library" → Install. Updates also surface here.
   - **Manual:** download `plugin-vod2mlib-v<version>.zip` from a [GitHub release](https://github.com/R3XCHRIS/VOD2MLIB/releases), then Dispatcharr → Plugins → **Import** → upload the zip.

3. Enable the plugin from the Plugins tab.

Requires Dispatcharr **v0.24.0** or later. The auto-rescan feature additionally needs `django-celery-beat` (Dispatcharr ships with it).

## Sharing the VODs folder with media servers

This is the part most people get wrong on first try.

The plugin runs **inside the Dispatcharr container**. When it writes `/VODS/Movies/Aladdin (1992)/Aladdin (1992).strm`, that path exists inside the container's filesystem. For Jellyfin / ChannelsDVR / Kodi to find that file, **the same data has to be visible to them too** — either as a bind-mounted volume on the same host, or via a network share.

**Three common patterns**, pick whichever matches your setup:

### 1. Same host, both apps in Docker (recommended)

Bind-mount the same host directory into both containers. The plugin writes; the media server reads.

```yaml
services:
  dispatcharr:
    volumes:
      - /opt/dispatcharr-vods:/VODS    # plugin writes here

  jellyfin:
    volumes:
      - /opt/dispatcharr-vods:/data/vods:ro    # read-only mount
    # then in Jellyfin: Add Library → Movies → /data/vods/Movies
    #                                  Shows  → /data/vods/Series
```

`:ro` (read-only) is good practice for the consumer — guarantees Jellyfin can't accidentally modify the plugin's output.

### 2. Media server on the same host, *not* in Docker

Just point the media server at the host path directly:

```
/opt/dispatcharr-vods/Movies   # for Movies library
/opt/dispatcharr-vods/Series   # for Series library
```

Watch out for **file permissions** — the Dispatcharr container writes as its own UID (often `1000`/`dispatch`). If your media server runs under a different user, it may not be able to read the `.strm` files. Easiest fix: align UIDs, or `chmod -R a+r /opt/dispatcharr-vods`.

### 3. Media server on a different host

Export the directory over NFS/SMB from the host running Dispatcharr, mount it on the host running the media server.

```bash
# On the Dispatcharr host (Linux + NFS):
echo "/opt/dispatcharr-vods 192.168.1.0/24(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)" >> /etc/exports
sudo exportfs -ra

# On the media server host:
sudo mount -t nfs dispatcharr-host:/opt/dispatcharr-vods /mnt/vods
# ... then point Jellyfin/Plex/Emby at /mnt/vods/{Movies,Series}
```

SMB works equally well; pick whatever your stack already uses.

### One critical setting either way

The `Dispatcharr URL` in plugin settings is **baked into every `.strm` file** — it's the URL the media server's player follows when you press Play. It MUST be reachable from wherever your media server runs:

- Same host: a LAN IP works (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:9191`).
- Different host on same LAN: still a LAN IP, just make sure routing/firewall allows it.
- Different network: a routable hostname/IP, possibly via Tailscale, VPN, or reverse proxy.

`localhost` / `127.0.0.1` will not work — your media server is a different process, possibly on a different machine. The plugin actively rejects this.

## Settings

The Settings tab is grouped into five sections:

| Section | Field | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Paths & hosts** | Root Folder for Movies / Series | Paths inside the container (defaults `/VODS/Movies`, `/VODS/Series`) |
|  | Dispatcharr URL | Externally-reachable URL of Dispatcharr (NOT `localhost`). Baked into every `.strm`. |
| **Movies** | Batch Size | How many movies to process per click |
|  | Generate Movie NFO Files | Toggle Kodi/Jellyfin metadata generation |
|  | Nest Movies by Category | Wrap each movie folder inside a subfolder named by its M3U category (off by default; movies without a category go to `Unassigned/`) |
|  | Dedupe Movies Across Categories | When nesting is ON and a movie is tagged with multiple categories upstream, write under the first category only (alphabetical) instead of duplicating. No effect when nesting is OFF. Off by default (preserves 4K-vs-HD variant-stream behaviour). ⚠ Doesn't remove existing duplicate folders — `[⚠ DANGER] Clean up` + re-generate to migrate. |
|  | Append TMDB ID to folder names | Append `{tmdb-NNN}` to Movie *and* Series folder names when a TMDB ID is known — e.g. `Cool Hand Luke (1967) {tmdb-378}/`. Plex/CDVR honour this for forced exact metadata matches. Off by default. ⚠ Doesn't rename existing folders in place — writes new names alongside the old ones; `[⚠ DANGER] Clean up` + re-generate to migrate cleanly. |
| **Series** | Batch Size (Series) | How many series to process per click |
|  | Generate Series NFO Files | Toggle `tvshow.nfo` and per-episode `.nfo` |
|  | Refresh Existing Series | Re-evaluate already-processed series for new episodes AND rewrite existing episode `.strm` URLs (cron-friendly). Preserves `tvshow.nfo` and episode `.nfo` edits. |
|  | Nest Series by Category | Wrap each series folder inside a subfolder named by its M3U category (off by default; series without a category go to `Unassigned/`) |
|  | Dedupe Series Across Categories | When nesting is ON and a series is tagged with multiple categories upstream, write under the first category only (alphabetical) instead of duplicating. No effect when nesting is OFF. Off by default. ⚠ Doesn't remove existing duplicate folders — `[⚠ DANGER] Clean up` + re-generate to migrate. |
| **Notifications** | Webhook URL | Discord/Slack incoming-webhook URL, or any endpoint for a generic JSON payload. Empty = disabled. |
|  | Webhook Format | `Auto-detect` (default), or force `Discord` / `Slack` / `Generic JSON` |
|  | Notify Even When Nothing Changed | Off by default — a run that adds/refreshes/deletes nothing (and hits no errors) is silently skipped, so nightly no-op cron rescans don't spam the channel |
| **Auto-rescan schedule** | Schedule (cron) | Standard 5-field expression. Default `0 3 * * *` (daily 03:00) |
|  | Schedule Timezone | IANA timezone the cron is interpreted in (e.g. `Europe/London`). Empty = UTC. Handles DST automatically. |
|  | Scheduled Action | What the cron fires (full rescan recommended) |

## Webhook notifications

Every `[GENERATE]` action, `[GENERATE] Full rescan`, and `[⚠ DANGER] Clean up` already tracks exactly what it did — movies/episodes added, refreshed, skipped (already on disk), deduped, or deleted, plus an error count — and prints it to the run log. Setting a **Webhook URL** sends that same summary to Discord, Slack, or any other endpoint as JSON, right after the action finishes (including cron-triggered rescans, not just manual clicks).

- **Discord** — paste a channel's incoming-webhook URL (`Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks`). Posts a rich embed with a colored sidebar (green = changes made, red = errors, gray = no-op) and one field per stat.
- **Slack** — paste an incoming-webhook URL (`api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks`). Posts a plain-text message listing the same stats.
- **Anything else** — posts `{"plugin": "vod2mlib", "action": ..., "title": ..., "message": ..., "stats": {...}, "errors": ...}` as generic JSON, so you can point it at ntfy, Gotify, Home Assistant, n8n, or your own relay.

Read-only actions (`Scan`, `Show status`, `Apply/Remove schedule`) never fire a webhook. By default a run that made zero changes is skipped too — turn on **Notify Even When Nothing Changed** if you want a heartbeat on every tick regardless. Delivery is best-effort: a failed or unreachable webhook is logged as a warning and never fails the underlying Generate/Rescan/Clean up action.

## Workflow

**First run.** Configure paths → click `[LIBRARY] Catalogue snapshot` to verify the plugin can see your VODs → click `[GENERATE] Movies` with Batch Size 10 → spot-check the output → scale up.

**Scaling up.** Increase Batch Size, click again. Existing files are skipped, so each click only processes new ones. (If you need to refresh URLs in already-generated files — typically after changing the `Dispatcharr URL` setting — use `[GENERATE] Full rescan` instead; it rewrites all existing `.strm` while preserving your `.nfo` edits.)

**Auto-rescan.**
1. Turn ON **Refresh Existing Series**.
2. Set **Scheduled Action** to **Full rescan**.
3. Click `[SCHEDULE] Apply / Update`.
4. Verify with `[SCHEDULE] Show status` — last run / total runs populate after the first cron tick.
5. Optional: click `[SCHEDULE] Test fire now` to immediately replay the scheduled action without waiting for the next cron tick.

The cron snapshots your settings at click-time. **Re-click Apply after changing any setting** to refresh the snapshot.

## Plex compatibility

Plex does **not** play `.strm` files (it can index them but the URL inside doesn't play). This is a long-standing Plex limitation — it's been an unfulfilled feature request for 5+ years.

Workable alternatives:

- **Jellyfin alongside Plex.** Jellyfin plays `.strm` natively. Run it in a container next to Plex, point both at the same library folder (see [Sharing the VODs folder](#sharing-the-vods-folder-with-media-servers) above).
- **ChannelsDVR's Personal Media** — works perfectly out of the box. Point CDVR at the Movies/Series root.
- **Kodi** — works.
- **Emby** — works.

## Troubleshooting

**"Unknown action" error in the toast.** Dispatcharr cached an old version of the plugin module. `docker restart dispatcharr` clears it. Toggling enable/disable on the plugin also forces a reload.

**The Run button drops below the action title instead of right-aligning.** That's Dispatcharr's UI flex-wrap when the description spans 2+ lines. We keep descriptions single-line to avoid this; if it happens again, the description is too long for your viewport.

**Cron task registered but didn't fire.** Check `[SCHEDULE] Show status` — `last_run` should populate after the first scheduled tick. If still `never` after the expected time:
- Verify Celery beat is running in your Dispatcharr deployment.
- Check container logs for `core.scheduling Updated periodic task 'vod2mlib.auto_rescan'`.
- Click `[SCHEDULE] Test fire now` to confirm the task itself works (proves it's a scheduling-layer issue, not a plugin issue).

**Schedule fires but no new files appear.** Most likely: `Refresh Existing Series` is OFF and your existing series already have folders, so the cron only adds *new* series. Toggle Refresh Existing ON, click Apply Schedule again to update the snapshot.

**Media server can't see the generated files at all.** The host path isn't shared with the media server's process. See [Sharing the VODs folder](#sharing-the-vods-folder-with-media-servers).

**Media server sees the files but playback fails immediately.** Open one of the `.strm` files in a text editor — it contains a single URL. Try fetching that URL from the machine running your media server (`curl -I <url>`). If that fails, the `Dispatcharr URL` setting isn't reachable from there. Fix the URL, then run `[GENERATE] Full rescan` — every existing `.strm` is rewritten with the new URL, and your `.nfo` edits are preserved. (Pre-v1.13.0 you had to `[⚠ DANGER] Clean up` then regenerate, which also wiped any user `.nfo` edits.)

**Playback worked initially but starts failing after a few days / after a Dispatcharr refresh.** (Symptom: Emby/Jellyfin reports "No compatible streams" on titles that previously played fine; CDVR reports 404s on files that worked yesterday.) Upstream Dispatcharr bug — VOD movie/episode UUIDs are regenerated on every M3U refresh, so the URLs your media server cached at library-scan time become orphaned ([Dispatcharr#961](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr/issues/961)). The plugin can't fix this externally — rewriting `.strm` files doesn't help because Emby/Jellyfin only re-reads them at library-scan time, not on playback retry. The read-side fix [Dispatcharr#1315](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr/pull/1315) is **merged to `dev`** (verified working in production): switch your Dispatcharr container from `:latest` to `:dev` and dead-UUID requests will resolve via the stable `stream_id` that every VOD2MLIB URL already carries.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  dispatcharr:
    image: ghcr.io/dispatcharr/dispatcharr:dev    # was :latest
    # ...rest of your config
```

Closed [Dispatcharr#973](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr/pull/973) would be the complementary write-side root fix (preserves UUIDs across refresh instead of just tolerating the orphaning); it's stalled and needs reviving. This note will be removed once a tagged Dispatcharr release contains the fix.

**"All profiles at capacity" error when playing on TiviMate / Android.** Not a `.strm` issue — this is a known Dispatcharr connection-counting bug ([Dispatcharr #451](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr/issues/451)). TiviMate (and similar Android players) makes multiple simultaneous Range requests to probe a file before playback; Dispatcharr counts each request as a separate provider connection, blowing through `max_streams=1` before playback even starts. The community plugin [`dispatcharr_vod_fix`](https://github.com/cedric-marcoux/dispatcharr_vod_fix) patches Dispatcharr's request handling to track slots by (client IP + content UUID) so multiple Range requests share one slot. Install it alongside this plugin if your Android clients can't play VOD content.

**Folders named `Aladdin (2026) (2026)` (duplicate year).** This was a bug in v1.4 and earlier. Fixed in v1.5+ but pre-existing duplicate-year folders aren't auto-renamed. Run `[⚠ DANGER] Clean up Movies` once to remove them, then re-run `[GENERATE] Movies` to regenerate cleanly. (Cleanup deletes only `.strm`/`.nfo` — user-added subtitles/posters survive.)

**Generate Series fails for some series.** The summary lists the failed series names with their errors. Common causes: M3U upstream timeout, malformed episode metadata. The plugin continues with the rest of the batch.

**`localhost`/`127.0.0.1` in Dispatcharr URL.** The plugin refuses to write `.strm` with a localhost URL — your media server can't resolve it. Use the container's reachable IP/hostname.

## Development

Pure-helper unit tests live in `tests/`. From the repo root:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

The tests don't need Django or a running Dispatcharr — they exercise `_clean_title`, `_strip_trailing_year`, `_sanitize_filename`, `_parse_cron`, `_extract_genres`, `_mask_url`, and the path-building helpers in isolation. 45 tests, ~50ms.

The bundled logo is reproducible — replace `tools/source_logo.png` and run `python3 tools/build_logo.py` to regenerate `logo.png` at 512×512 with NEAREST resampling (preserves pixel-art crispness).

## Architecture (for contributors)

- The plugin is a single `plugin.py` declaring a `Plugin` class with `fields`, `actions`, and `run()` per Dispatcharr's plugin contract.
- `plugin.json` is the manifest the [Dispatcharr/Plugins catalogue](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Plugins) reads. Dispatcharr's runtime reads action metadata from the Python class — the JSON is for the catalogue and pre-enable preview.
- Schedule registration uses `django-celery-beat`'s `PeriodicTask` + `CrontabSchedule`. The cron-fired task is a module-level `@shared_task` named `vod2mlib.scheduled_rescan` that constructs a fresh `Plugin()` and dispatches.
- Settings are snapshotted into the PeriodicTask's `kwargs` at Apply-time so the cron runs with deterministic config. Re-click Apply to refresh.
