"""
VOD to Media Library — Dispatcharr VOD .strm Generator Plugin
(slug: vod2mlib)
v1.16.0 — language-prefix stripping for pipe / space / bullet formats
          (EN|, EN, ▪NL▪); new Category Filter (include-only) to limit
          generation to chosen languages/categories; option to omit
          ?stream_id= from .strm URLs for provider failover (#6, #3, #5).
